# The Bridge of Knowledge

From Spain to Brazil, across oceans wide,
A digital bridge of wisdom now stands tall.
Where children's minds may wander and abide,
As G;RADIO's framework holds them in thrall.

Through turtle's path and pixels bright with hope,
Young hearts discover worlds both far and near.
A flight of fancy with the power to cope,
With distance that would otherwise appear.

Two nations linked by history and dreams,
Distinct in language, united in soul.
Through code and story flow these vibrant streams,
Where education plays its vital role.

  DMC Propaganda's art thus brings
  The joy of learning upon turtle wings.
